It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of AIPs to a new champion. In general, we’d like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred AIP, but that’s really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the AIP process, or has fallen off the face of the net (i.e. is unreachable or isn’t responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don’t agree with the direction of the AIP. We try to build consensus around an AIP, but if that’s not possible, you can always submit a competing AIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of an AIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the AIP editor. If the original author doesn’t respond to email in a timely manner, the AIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it’s not like such decisions can’t be reversed).
