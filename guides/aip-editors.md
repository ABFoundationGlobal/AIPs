## AIP Editors Responsibilities

For each new AIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

- Read the AIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Check the AIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style etc.

If the AIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the AIP is ready for the repository, the AIP editor will:

- Assign an AIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this AIP)

- Merge the corresponding pull request

- Send a message back to the AIP author with the next step.

Many AIPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Newton codebase. The AIP editors monitor AIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgment on AIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.
